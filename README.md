# dadjokes

A flutter project, that fetches a random joke from https://jokefather.com/api/jokes/random

I use backend on dart_frog to reach the API (couldn't get it from frontend because of CORS)

It's my study pet-project.

P.S. I didn't copypast the flutter tutorial, yet I've wathed it two months ago and tried to build same features from memory... but my own way.
